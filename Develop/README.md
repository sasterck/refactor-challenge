# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor
 
# Overview:
This challenge was considered an "on-the-job ticket" where I was provided a code and had to modify it. For this project, I was tasked with improving a business marketing company's website code to better its "accessibility".
 
# Changes made:
- Removed "div" and added semantic HTML elements
-Added specific title
-changed the footer from h2 to h4 to follow a logical structure
-added alt attributes to images
-simplified CSS by deleting unnecessary sections and repeats
-made sure the header, body, footer, etc were in the right place.
 
# Additional comments:
 
-I tried my best to adhere to the scout rule!
-When working my computer crashed and I had issues pushing to the GitHub repo and had to troubleshoot with an AskBC person multiple times. I wasn't able to add as many commits as I would have liked due to this.
